        <h4>What is Click to Chat?</h4>
        <p>
            WhatsApp's Click to Chat feature allows you to begin a chat with someone without having their phone number saved in 
            your phone's address book. As long as you know this personâ€™s phone number, you can create a link that will allow you to start 
            a chat with them. By clicking the link, a chat with the person automatically opens. 
            Click to Chat works on both your phone and WhatsApp Web.<br>
            For a detailed explanation on international numbers, read <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/general/21016748" target="_blank"> this article</a>.

        <h4>How to Use</h4>
