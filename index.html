        <h4>What is Click to Chat?</h4>
        <p>
            WhatsApp's Click to Chat feature allows you to begin a chat with someone without having their phone number saved in 
            your phone's address book. As long as you know this personâ€™s phone number, you can create a link that will allow you to start 
            a chat with them. By clicking the link, a chat with the person automatically opens. 
            Click to Chat works on both your phone and WhatsApp Web.

        <h4>Am I being Recorded?</h4>
        <p>
            Absolutely not. However you are free to check the code itself from <a href="https://github.com/1bl4z3r/Click-To-Chat" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
            I have not used any libraries, or scripts from 3rd parties, nor I have added any tracking /storage scripts.
            I did it becaause I had too much time to waste.
